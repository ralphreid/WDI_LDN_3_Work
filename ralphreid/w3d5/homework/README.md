Specification for CookBook App:

You’ve been tasked with creating a Rails app that models a common cookbook's behaviour. It should allow users to create and look at recipes, as well as see ingredients needed and cooking directions. Your app should have at least a Recipe model with its CRUD actions, and an Ingredient model with its CRUD actions.

Remember: an individual Recipe can have lots of Ingredients, and an Ingredient can be used in lots of Recipes, so you need to determine the database structure that supports this.

Make sure you’re also practicing your newly acquired styling skills, and make your app look pretty!

We’re not doing anything new in this homework - this weekend is all about practice, and repetition, repetition, repetition. We want to see working code on Monday!
