## ATM LAB Revisited

###Goal:
* The goal of this lab is to get used to the jQuery syntax
* Practice using jQuery to manipulate the DOM

### To do:
* Replace the JavaScript selectors with [jQuery ones](http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/).
* Replace the JavaScript events with [jQuery ones](http://api.jquery.com/category/events/).
* Add events to ensure input is a number (use [keyup](http://api.jquery.com/keyup/)).

### Bonus:
* Animate number changes to count between the balances when they change.
* Refactor the code to include principals you learned from the Todo app.
* Write Jasmine tests
