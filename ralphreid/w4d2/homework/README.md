Had a strage issue through out the session where as bundle exec was not running properly. Had to start and restart the project from scratch but made progress this morning.
I went back to an earlier commit. So I may have an orphan branch somewhere...so it would be helpful to understand how to clean this up at some point.

Ok. with the content but but got stuck on:
  the add a users/edit view that ONLY allows the role of a user to be edited (and NOT name,
email etc.)
  make it so that only a user logged in as an admin can change a user's role using this
form
  try to prevent a situation where the last admin removes their own admin status as
then their would be no way to change roles anymore
