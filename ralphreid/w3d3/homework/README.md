Questions:
1. what am i missing in the Models, like do I use attr....
2. how do I know when to use CHANGE method or up method in the migration?
3. I am not 100% sure when an instance varialbe is required in the controller…I would like to know in which cases a local varialble is sufficient and why
4. Can I route to an index landing page in the view or does it allways need to be inside a folder inside view named as a controller?

Mention what you struggled with
- am not sure how to access the relationships in the controller. Should I create a method on the exisiting controllers or build a new controller….once I get this, i think I can finish the views

How did you feel (good or bad) while working on the homework
Good - it was more time consuing getting to this place than I thought.
I spend several hours and actually recreated the app becasuse I could not start the server…which was all down to incorrect root routing.

Pseudo Code
User creates, views and edits movies
User creates, views and edits actors
User can view the relationships
User can edit the relationships

----------------------------------------------
Backlog
Order the index lists
Add more discriptive link text to actors index links (so more than just first name)
Add edit links to show tables
update form tags
