Questions:
1. what am i missing in the Models, like do I use attr....
2. how do I know when to use CHANGE method or up method in the migration?
3. I am not 100% sure when an instance varialbe is required in the controllerâ€¦I would like to know in which cases a local varialble is sufficient and why
4. Can I route to an index landing page in the view or does it allways need to be inside a folder inside view named as a controller?

Pseudo Code
User creates, views and edits movies
User creates, views and edits actors
User can view the relationships
User can edit the relationships

----------------------------------------------
Backlog
Order the index lists
Add more discriptive link text to actors index links (so more than just first name)
