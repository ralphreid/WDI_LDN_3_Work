For David
- as the current model stands, it apears that I could have the same book object in multiple bookshelves. If I wanted to extend the model & attributes, how could I build in the use case that each book itself can only be on one bookshelf?
- my library model seems a bit orphaned, how could i incorporate it more effectively?

- ran out of time to finish bookshelf view and controller. I am stuck on the exact methods as I have tested the rough code and got errors. I can use the console to manipulate the various objects but need a bit of supprot translating this into the controller




Backlog
- build in Library interface
