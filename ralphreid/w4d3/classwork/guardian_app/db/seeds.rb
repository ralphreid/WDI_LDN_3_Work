In the period between the wars, he was one of Britain's most influential theatre critics. After working in his father's business until his late twenties he found his way into journalism, being on the staff of The Manchester Guardian (1907–14); drama critic for The Saturday Review (1921–23), and The Sunday Times (1923–47), and holding the same post for the BBC (1925–32).Agate's diaries and letters, published in a series of nine volumes under the title of Ego, are a record of the British theatre of his era and also of his non-theatrical interests, including sports, social gossip and his private preoccupations with his health and precarious finances. In addition to drama criticism he wrote about the cinema and English literature for London newspapers, and published three novels, translated a play and had it staged in London, albeit briefly, and regularly brought out collections of his theatre essays and reviews.")

He said the money could be used to help the poor as they struggle with massive energy bills this winter. He claimed many people this winter will face a choice between eating or staying warm. His remarks at a press gallery lunch in Westminster will be a severe political shock to Downing Street, which has insisted there is nothing the government can do to combat rising energy prices except urge consumers to shop around for cheaper tariffs or foster greater competition in the market. The former Tory leader described recent hikes in electricity and gas bills of approximately 10% as \"unacceptable\". He argued that the coalition needed to show that it was supporting \"people, not institutions\". The Labour leader, Ed Miliband, has dominated the political debate on energy prices since his party conference speech promising a 20-month price freeze if he is elected in 2015. Major's proposal is different since it is a tax on excess profits. The energy companies insist that price rises are not designed to increase profits, but are in response to increases in wholesale gas prices. It is likely to be highly awkward for David Cameron that a former Conservative prime minister believes it is necessary to suggest such a direct intervention in the market at a time when the prime minister has dismissed Miliband's proposals as Marxist or a con. Major, who is normally loyal to Cameron, may just be flying a political kite for a faction inside Downing Street. George Osborne, the chancellor, has previously imposed emergency levies on the excess profits of the banks, so such a measure is not anathema to Conservative thinking. But there are practical difficulties and many of the energy companies insist they need the profits to invest in new technology and meet government-imposed green obligations. There is also an intense dispute between Ofgem, the energy regulator, and the energy companies on the precise levels of their profits. Ofgem has just announced a review of energy company profitability, following criticism in the summer by the Commons energy and climate change select committee of the lack of transparency by the big six energy firms. Bosses from the big six are due to give evidence to the energy committee next Tuesday in a hastily arranged session. Sir Robert Smith, the Liberal Democrat acting chairman of the committee, said: \"The committee has today decided to call in the energy bosses in the context of the latest wave of price increases.\" Three of the big six have announced price rises in recent weeks: 8.2% by SSE, 10.4% for electricity and 8.4% for gas by British Gas, and 9.3% and 11.1% respectively by npower. The committee said the session will explore a range of issues, including reasons and justification behind recent energy price rises, the difference of pricing policies between energy suppliers, and how the transparency of energy company profits can be improved.")

The Children's Investment Fund owns a 5.8% stake in the 500-year-old postal service, making it the largest shareholder behind the government, which has a 38% stake. TCI is controlled by publicity-shy Chris Hohn, who pressed for the sale of ABN Amro, which ended in the Dutch bank's disastrous takeover by the Royal Bank of Scotland, and has been dubbed a \"locust\" in Germany for its investment style. TCI's stake in Royal Mail came to light under stock market rules obliging investors to report holdings greater than 5%, and was seized on by government critics who argue that the business secretary failed small investors by selling the shares off to \"big money\" in the City and failing to live up to his promise to sell them to long-term investors. TCI revealed that it owns 58.1m shares, on a day when the shares rose to 499p, slightly down on last week but still 50% higher than the 330p the shares were sold at. Hohn, the Surrey-born chief executive of TCI, is also among the UK's most generous philanthropists and first came to prominence in 2005 after he ousted the chief executive of Deutsche Börse, Werner Seifert, ending his bid to take over the London Stock Exchange. Seifert retaliated by branding TCI partners and its US equivalents \"locusts\". The bulk of the controversial hedge fund's stake in Royal Mail is likely to have been bought on the stock market rather than directly from the government, but it may still raise hackles among trade unionists who recently voted for a nationwide 24-hour strike next month. It has also reignited criticism from Labour that Royal Mail was sold on the cheap. Ian Murray, the shadow minister for trade and investment, argued that small investors had been failed by the government's \"fire sale\". \"We have seen small investors losing out while the vast majority of shares sold have gone to big-money investors in the City,\" he said. \"Vince Cable claimed that the sale would prioritise long-term investors but serious questions will be asked on whether this is the case, not least given the huge volume of trades in Royal Mail shares which we have seen in the first days of trading, running into hundreds of millions.\" He added: \"This is on top of real concerns that taxpayers have been left short-changed to the tune of hundreds of millions of pounds at a time when families across Britain are facing a cost of living crisis.\" Cable told a committee of MPs earlier this month the government was in \"a position to ensure that we do get the right kind of investor community\". He said: \"We are talking about pension funds and insurance companies that hold the savings of millions of people, and we have been very clear that that is the kind of relationship we want to have, that is long-termism.\" A spokesman at the business department referred to these comments and said the government was not disappointed with a hedge fund owner, adding: \"It is not a matter for us, it is a matter for the company.\" TCI and Royal Mail declined to comment. Hedge funds have been among the city institutions and retail investors scrambling for a slice of Royal Mail, in part because they believe modernisation of the postal service could happen faster than planned. David Buik, a market commentator at Panmure Gordon, described Hohn as an extremely shrewd businessman. \"My guess is that he thinks it is a probably a very good company. I suspect he thinks it is undervalued – I suspect he has bought his stake in it for that reason.\" Neither will it have escaped his attention that Royal Mail is a plum takeover target, Buik added. \"If things don't work out on an independent basis, it would look very cosy in the portfolio of UPS or Deutsche Post.\" TCI has grown into one of the world's largest hedge funds since its creation in 2003, and currently has $11bn in assets under management. In recent months it has been buying into companies with corporate governance concerns, such as Japan Tobacco and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp in the wake of the phone hacking scandal. Since News Corp was split, TCI now owns a stake in Twentieth Century Fox.")

The company made it clear that rejection of change would result in closure. Regrettably, the union advised union members to reject any form of change. The outcome of the employee vote on the company’s Survival Plan was a 50/50 split. Within this, almost all of the administrative staff voted for the company’s plan but a large majority of shop floor employees voted to reject it. The shareholders met yesterday to consider the future of the business following the result of the employee vote.

Australian fire authorities believed Wednesday would provide extremely dangerous fire conditions for the Blue Mountains region, west of Sydney, with low humidity and winds gusting up to 100km an hour. Residents were advised to leave the area prior to lunchtime, although there have only been sporadic evacuations. Successful containment of fires resulted in people allowed to return to their homes in the afternoon. Elsewhere, pupils at a school in Newcastle were moved following the flaring of a separate fire. In an unusual development, it has been confirmed that the Australian army triggered one of the major fires by a training exercise that involved explosives. One of the most severe fires is moving towards the town of Minmi, where two schools have been evacuated and residents told to take shelter. The two other emergency fires are at Lake Macquarie and Springwood, which has seen water-carrying helicopters strafe the flames. Shane Fitzsimmons, the NSW Rural Fire Service’s commissioner, said firefighters face challenging conditions, although the weather should be more favourable on Thursday. “We still have a few hours yet of the strong winds and warmer conditions,” he said. “The winds are expected to continue right through to nightfall and beyond. “We are expecting ... that there will be a swing around overnight to a more southerly influence. It will be a dry change though … and we’ll see a dry, cooler day tomorrow with fairly strong southwesterly winds, 40km/h gusting 60-80km/h.” “Whatever unfolds throughout the afternoon today, there will still be a lot of fire edge that firefighters have to deal with throughout tomorrow, the coming days and coming weeks.” Despite the conditions, there were no reports of property losses on Wednesday, although Fitzsimmons warned that the status of more than 60 separate fires could change rapidly. “We have seen today, and indeed building throughout this week, one of the most significant threats to the Blue Mountains and Hawkesbury communities that's unparalleled,” he said, warning that residents shouldn’t be complacent after emerging relatively unscathed from the day. “Never before have we seen the extent of damage and destruction, and wide-scale fire activity at this time of the year,” he said. “It's indicative of the unseasonably dry, hot conditions that have been building now throughout winter and into spring. “We need to remind ourselves that we have a long way to go as we look down the coming months into summer and the bushfire danger period for NSW. “We've seen that threat to the Blue Mountains and Hawkesbury communities averted. We've seen it averted because we've seen the best of skills on display, taking on board decisions and actions, weighing up all their options, and embarking on some very deliberate, some very measured, aggressive, and high-risk strategies.” The conditions resulted in one of the largest firefighting forces ever to be assembled in NSW, with more than 1,400 volunteers and professional staff deployed in the worst hit areas of the Blue Mountains, Hunter Valley and Sydney area. The total fire area has a perimeter of 1,600km, raising the possibility that controlled fires could continue flaring for weeks, or even months. The bushfire emergency started last Thursday, with fires concentrated in the Blue Mountains, Hunter Valley and greater Sydney area. Fires have so far destroyed 208 homes, with one man losing his life. ")

News that Facebook had lifted a ban on images of graphic violence prompted a public outcry on Tuesday, with the UK prime minister, David Cameron, joining condemnation of the decision. In response, the social networking site has backed down and removed the video, which shows a masked man beheading a woman in Mexico. \"When we review content that is reported to us, we will take a more holistic look at the context surrounding a violent image or video,\" it said in a statement on Tuesday. \"Second, we will consider whether the person posting the content is sharing it responsibly, such as accompanying the video or image with a warning and sharing it with an age-appropriate audience.\" Facebook bans displays of topless photos of women under rules addressing nudity and pornography, but its owners had initially resisted suggestions that the Mexican video should be taken down, arguing that the public should be free to view beheading videos then condemn the content. It said it would take a different approach if the actions in the footage were \"encouraged or celebrated\". Following complaints, the website's owners added captions to the front of videos warning that they contained extremely graphic content and that they \"may be upsetting\". But that was not enough to mollify the prime minister, who said Facebook should explain its decision to \"worried \". Facebook allows people to use the site from the age of 13, although many 11-year-olds join when they go to secondary school. Hostage UK, a charity representing the families of people who have been kidnapped and killed, said: \"The public are well aware of the brutalities committed, and a public showing … adds nothing other than to cause further unimaginable suffering.\" On Tuesday, Facebook caved into the pressure and admitted it had been wrong to refuse to remove the beheading video. \"Based on these enhanced standards we have re-examined recent reports of graphic content and have concluded that this content improperly and irresponsibly glorifies violence. For this reason we have removed it,\" the company said. Facebook had introduced a temporary ban on such videos in May but later decided to remove the block on the grounds that the site is used to share information about world events.")
